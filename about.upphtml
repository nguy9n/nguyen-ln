<h1>about the site</h1>
<p>hi! i'm lnguyen, the owner of this site. as it says on the home page, i'm a PhD student with a deep love for all things evolution and
microbiology. i also love jank, diy and to kiss (keep it simple, stupid); all things which have culminated in the creation of this website.</p>

<p>i've gone through my fair share of static site generators, including jekyll, hugh and arise, but have run into issues with each in one way or another. in fact, my <a href=https://periplaneta.neocities.org>old website</a> was made using jekyll, and later hugh, but my deployment workflow was such a mess that i just have not been able to update it without breaking it. it exists mostly as an archive, as i do love the 2000s geocities visuals that i concocted. this iteration was built with <a href=https://mkws.sh/>mkws</a>, in an attempt at a much simpler website created with a much simpler static site generator. i wanted to keep the retro website feeling, but eschewed much of the 2000s geocities kitsch to make something a little less headache-inducing. i love <i>projects</i>, and making and maintaining a website is one of my favorite types of project. yippee!</p>

<p>there's not much i often find worth posting on a website that mostly only i look at. however, i find it deeply rewarding to be able to write longform on a platform free from likes, comments or any type of algorithm. sometimes it's good to take it slow! most likely, i'll write about projects that i work on, from diy film developing to website-making to potentially gamedev in the future. who knows what kind of journey we'll go on together, but i hope you'll join me for the ride. love you. stay safe out there.</p>
